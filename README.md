# My Web Dev Journey: From HTML to Internship in 3 Months.

## My Story
It's probably every brown parent's worst nightmare when their smart daughter gives up her dreams of becoming a doctor because she can draw really wiggly lines with Python. 
I never intended on doing anything CS related for 18.5/19 years of my life. I really *really* was the last person who'd do anything related to tech. It all changed when I ended up taking an introductory programming course in my freshman year at university. Well not really. While I treated the course as a general requirement, I was intrigued by how CS seemed kinda freaking cool and also not as intimidating as it can seem. It was only in the following semester when I took some more CS courses that I began to start learning more about the various applications of CS in other fields. As the summer of 2020 dawned on me (global pandemic and everything), I decided I'd explore Web Development as a starting point on exploring a whole universe of a field. I was fairly confident that my knowledge of loops and classes got me covered.

## The Journey
I could not have been more wrong. Oh so wrong. Not only was I intimidated to get to actually learning things I had no idea about, but the further I got into this bubble, the bigger I realised it was. Nevertheless, I was determined to do this and so here's how I went from learning HTML to bagging my first Web Dev Internship in just 3 months. 
* In May, I enrolled in a Udemy course for JavaScript and got comfortable with making static pages. 
* In June, I enrolled in a second Udemy course - The Complete Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele. This month I really got into understanding the backend, working with APIs and learning the technologies of the MERN stack. 
Both courses are extremely well structured and explained a lot of concepts brilliantly. Plus, they're super economical. I'd highly reccommend them although if you're interested in other options there are plenty of YouTube tutorials and explanations to just about anything. 
* In July, as I was testing my knowledge by building an entire MERN stack application, I applied and interviewed for a company that eventually offered me a Web Development Internship at the end of the month. 

Here's a more detailed breakdown of what I learned over the course of 2 months and how I learned it:

### HTML

### CSS

### BootStrap 

### JavaScript

### Node

### Express

### MongoDB

### React
