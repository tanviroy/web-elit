# My Web Dev Journey: From HTML to Internship in 3 Months.

## My Story
It's probably every brown parent's worst nightmare when their smart daughter gives up her dreams of becoming a doctor because she can draw really wiggly lines with Python. 
I never intended on doing anything CS related for 18.5/19 years of my life. I really *really* was the last person who'd do anything related to tech. It all changed when I ended up taking an introductory programming course in my freshman year at university. Well not really. While I treated the course as a general requirement, I was intrigued by how CS seemed kinda freaking cool and also not as intimidating as it can seem. It was only in the following semester when I took some more CS courses that I began to start learning more about the various applications of CS in other fields. As the summer of 2020 dawned on me (global pandemic and everything), I decided I'd explore Web Development as a starting point on exploring a whole universe of a field. I was fairly confident that my knowledge of loops and classes got me covered.

## The Journey
I could not have been more wrong. Oh so wrong. Not only was I intimidated to get to actually learning things I had no idea about, but the further I got into this bubble, the bigger I realised it was. Nevertheless, I was determined to do this and so here's how I went from learning HTML to bagging my first Web Dev Internship in just 3 months. 
* In May, I enrolled in a Udemy course [The Complete JavaScript Course 2020 by Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/), learned JavaScript, and got comfortable with making static pages. 
* In June, I enrolled in a second Udemy course [The Complete Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/). This month I really got into understanding the backend, working with APIs and working with the technologies of the MERN stack. 
Both courses are extremely well structured and explained a lot of concepts brilliantly. Plus, they're super economical. I'd highly reccommend them although if you're interested in other options there are plenty of YouTube tutorials and explanations to just about anything. 
* In July, as I was testing my knowledge by building an entire MERN stack application, I applied and interviewed for a company that eventually offered me a Web Development Internship by the end of the month.

## The Key Ingredient to my Success
Projects. Projects. Projects. Almost every time, I learned something new, I tested it out then and there. I think the best way to not just learn but also learn *more* than you expected is to build something yourself. In the very beginning I found myself relying excessively on tutorials. I found that by adding new features to a guided project or doing things differently helped me ease out of that and broadened my own thinking. I also began crating a lot of silly websites eg. Defecation Station - a very simple game where you have to move a toilet to catch falling poop emojis. As stupid as the game was, it made me think hard about coding the game logic in JS. I have made tons of silly websites since then and I believe making things that aren't common, or better yet, that haven't been made before is a great way of pushing yourself, while making something you actually like. As you migrate to bigger projects, you'll notice that even incorporating a part of code from somewhere else in your codebase is a lot smoother because you actually understand what's going on instead of blindly copy-pasting something. 

I think personal projects are what *really* helped me as a total beginner. Right from the first few weeks of my journey, I learned Git and GitHub and began sharing my projects which not too many people would see, but I did it anyway. I cannot stress how much *more* you learn from making something yourself. Every error you'll encounter only pushes you on. When I casually applied for a Web Development Intern position knowing for sure I wouldn't get the role, it was my interest demonstrated through personal projects that I displayed publicly, that helped me get the internship. In fact, my interviewers commended me on the work I did and were convinced that not only did I have certain skills, but I also was someone who could learn something and apply it in a short span of time. 

Web Development is extremely vast and there are too many languages, tools, technologies and stacks one can learn. I chose to pick up the MERN stack as it was recommended by my professor. Despite getting an internship, this is by no means, the end. As immensely proud as I am for my hard work paying off, I am still, very much a noobie beginner to many, many things. The number of Babel errors I could never understand and the amount of things I learn about React even today are proof of this. So yeah, it's pretty impossible to master Web Development or even a single stack in 3 months. Technology is constantly changing. But pushing yourself to learn a lot, in a short amount of time, is a great way for a beginner to explore a particular galaxy in the beginner universe of Computer Science.
